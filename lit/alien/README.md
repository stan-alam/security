## Notes on Breaking and Entering

```text
When she arrived at MIT in the 1990s, Alien was quickly drawn to the school’s tradition
of high‑risk physical trespassing: the original “hacking.” Within a year, one of her
hallmates was dead and two others were arraigned. Alien’s adventures were only just
beginning.

After a stint at the storied, secretive Los Alamos National Laboratory, Alien was recruited
by a top cybersecurity firm where she deployed her cache of virtual weapons—and the trespassing
and social engineering talents she had developed while “hacking” at MIT. The company tested its
clients’ security by every means possible—not just coding, but donning disguises and sneaking past
guards and secretaries into the C‑suite.

Alien now runs a boutique hacking outfit that caters to some of the world’s biggest and most vulnerable
institutions—banks, retailers, government agencies. Her work combines devilish charm, old‑school deception,
and next generation spycraft. In Breaking and Entering, cybersecurity finally gets the rich, character‑driven,
fast-paced treatment it deserves.
